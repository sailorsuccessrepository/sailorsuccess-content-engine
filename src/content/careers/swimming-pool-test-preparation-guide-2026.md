# Swimming Pool Test for Merchant Navy 2026

The swimming test is a mandatory requirement for merchant navy admission in India. It separates those who've prepared from those who haven't. Here's exactly what you need to know.

## Why Is Swimming Required?

At sea, emergencies can require you to abandon ship. STCW (Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping) mandates that all seafarers have basic survival skills in water. The swimming test is the baseline check for this.

## What the Test Involves

### Standard IMU-CET Swimming Test
The most common format across Indian maritime colleges:

1. **Jump into deep water** from the poolside (approximately 1 meter height) without holding nose
2. **Swim 50 meters** continuously using any stroke
3. **Tread water for 10 minutes** without holding the pool edge or any support
4. **Don a lifejacket** in the water (sometimes tested separately)

Some colleges also include:
- Swimming 25 meters in uniform (to simulate abandonment)
- Floating on your back for 5 minutes

### Depth and Pool Requirements
Tests are conducted in pools minimum 1.5 meters deep. Most maritime colleges have their own pools or tie-ups with local clubs.

## Pass/Fail Standards

You must complete ALL components. Touching the lane rope, stopping mid-swim, or requiring assistance = fail. You typically get 2 attempts before rejection.

## Who Struggles Most

Aspirants from landlocked states (UP, MP, Rajasthan, Bihar) and those from non-swimming families. Bhai — this is fixable in 3 months with proper training.

## How to Prepare: 3-Month Plan

### Month 1 — Build Water Comfort
If you're a non-swimmer:
- Enroll at your nearest municipal swimming pool or club (₹500–₹1,500/month)
- Take 30 minutes of lessons daily for the first 2 weeks
- Goal: Be comfortable in deep water without panic
- Learn to float on your back — this is the survival position

### Month 2 — Build Stamina
- Swim laps daily — build to 200 meters continuous
- Practice treading water — target 15 minutes comfortably (so 10 minutes is easy)
- Practice jumping into the pool feet-first without holding nose
- Work on freestyle (front crawl) — most efficient stroke for the test

### Month 3 — Test Simulation
- Do full mock tests: jump, 50m swim, 10 minute tread
- Time yourself — you should clear 50m in under 4 minutes
- Practice wearing a lifejacket in water (borrow one from the swimming school or club)
- Swim in pool clothing once to simulate real conditions

## On Test Day

- Arrive well rested — physical performance drops with fatigue
- Don't eat a heavy meal 2 hours before
- Wear your swim trunks under the uniform if wearing clothes
- Stay calm during the tread — it's more mental than physical by this point
- Breathe steadily — panic breathing exhausts you fast

## Failed the Swimming Test — What Now?

Most colleges allow a re-test within a few months. Use that time properly. Some colleges offer a remedial swimming program. Don't give up — this is a learnable skill.

## Common Mistakes

1. **Not training in deep water** — practicing only in shallow water creates a mental block at test depth
2. **Skipping tread water practice** — candidates who only focus on laps fail the 10-minute tread
3. **Starting training too late** — 3 months is the minimum; 6 months is better
4. **Wrong stroke** — breaststroke is energy-efficient for distance; freestyle is fastest
