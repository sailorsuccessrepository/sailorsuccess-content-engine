# Types of Shipping Companies in India 2026

Not all shipping companies are equal. The company you join shapes your salary, your rank progression speed, your work-life balance, and your long-term career trajectory. Seedha baat — make this choice carefully.

## Indian Flag vs Foreign Flag

This is the most fundamental distinction.

### Indian Flag Companies (SCI, Great Eastern, Essar, Tolani, Mercator)
**Pros:**
- Continuity of service — easier to build seniority
- Shore leave in Indian ports
- Familiar legal framework
- Faster promotions in some companies due to smaller fleet size

**Cons:**
- Significantly lower salaries (30–50% less than foreign flag for same rank)
- Older fleet at some companies
- Less international exposure

**Best for:** Fresh cadets who want structured training, those who prefer less travel away from India.

### Foreign Flag Companies (Anglo-Eastern, BSM, Wallem, Synergy, Columbia)
**Pros:**
- Significantly higher salaries
- Modern vessels with latest technology
- International exposure — ports worldwide
- Dollar-denominated salary (NRI tax benefits)

**Cons:**
- Less continuity — contract to contract basis
- Managing gap periods between contracts
- Less familiar HR processes for Indian seafarers

**Best for:** Experienced officers wanting maximum earnings, those targeting international career.

## By Vessel Type

The cargo you carry defines your career specialisation. Switching types gets harder the more senior you become.

### Container Ships (Maersk, MSC, CMA CGM, Evergreen managed vessels)
- Fastest port turnarounds (24–48 hours)
- Complex cargo operations (reefer containers, dangerous goods)
- Tight schedule pressure — reliability is everything
- Good for those who like ports frequently

### Bulk Carriers (NYK, K-Line, MOL managed vessels)
- Longer port stays (2–5 days for loading/discharging)
- Relatively straightforward cargo operations
- Fewer ports, longer sea passages
- Good for officers who prefer the quieter rhythm

### Tankers — Oil, Chemical, LNG/LPG
- **Highest paying vessel type** — especially chemical and LNG
- Strict safety protocols (SIRE inspections, vetting procedures)
- Specialised cargo handling certification required (tanker endorsement)
- Oil tankers: VLCCs, Aframax, Suezmax — different scales of operation
- LNG/LPG: Highly specialised, difficult to enter, extraordinary pay

### Offshore Vessels (PSV, AHTS, DSV)
- Rotational schedules (28/28, 21/21 typical)
- Not STCW COC career path — separate licensing
- High demand, good pay, but different career than conventional shipping
- Based near oil fields — North Sea, Middle East, India's western coast

### Cruise Ships (Carnival, Royal Caribbean, Norwegian)
- Completely different environment — 3,000–5,000 passengers
- Hospitality focus alongside marine operations
- Good pay, excellent experience, but very long contracts
- High competition for Indian officers

## By Company Size

**Large fleet companies (100+ ships):** Anglo-Eastern, BSM, Wallem, Columbia
- More berths available = less waiting between contracts
- Structured career development programs
- Standardised procedures across fleet

**Mid-size companies (20–100 ships):** Great Eastern, Tolani, V.Ships
- More personal relationships with management
- Potentially faster promotion
- Less bureaucracy

**Small companies (<20 ships):** Various niche operators
- High risk — company instability can strand you
- Sometimes niche cargo specialisation is an advantage
- Due diligence essential (verify RPSL registration)

## How to Verify Any Shipping Company

Before joining any Indian ship management company, verify their **RPSL (Recruitment and Placement Service Licence)** at dgshipping.gov.in. Unlicensed companies are illegal and put your career at risk.
