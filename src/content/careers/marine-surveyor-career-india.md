# Marine Surveyor Career in India 2026

For seafarers looking to come ashore, marine surveying is one of the most respected and well-paying shore careers. You carry your technical expertise from sea and apply it in a new capacity. Here's the full picture.

## What Does a Marine Surveyor Do?

A marine surveyor inspects ships, cargo, and marine equipment to verify compliance with international regulations, insurance requirements, or commercial contracts. There are several specialisations:

**Classification Surveyors** (Lloyd's Register, Bureau Veritas, DNV, ABS, IRCS)
- Annual surveys, special surveys, dry-dock surveys
- Verify compliance with classification society rules
- Issue statutory certificates (SOLAS, MARPOL, LOADLINE)

**P&I Surveyors** (Club representatives)
- Investigate cargo damage claims, personal injury incidents
- Attend on-hire/off-hire surveys
- Report to P&I clubs on liability matters

**Cargo Surveyors**
- Draft survey (bulk cargo quantity verification)
- Condition surveys (damage assessment)
- Quality surveys (food grade, chemicals)

**Insurance Surveyors**
- Marine hull and machinery claims investigation
- Pre-purchase surveys
- Damage assessments for underwriters

**Flag State / DG Shipping Surveyors**
- Government employed
- Statutory inspections on Indian flag vessels

## Qualifications Required

**Minimum:** Certificate of Competency (COC) — Master/Chief Engineer preferred, but Chief Officer/Second Engineer acceptable for many roles.

**Preferred experience:** Minimum 5 years sea service including watchkeeping experience. Classification societies typically want 10+ years including senior officer experience.

**Certifications that help:**
- ISM auditor qualification
- IACS (International Association of Classification Societies) training
- Marine Insurance courses (Institute of London Underwriters)
- Cargo specialisation (IICL for containers, grain loading calculations)

## Classification Society Careers — The Gold Standard

Working for Lloyd's Register, Bureau Veritas, DNV, ABS, or Class NK is the most prestigious surveyor path.

**How to apply:**
1. Apply directly to their India offices (Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata)
2. Initial screening — COC verification, sea service review
3. Technical assessment
4. Training period (6–18 months) under senior surveyors
5. Authorised surveyor status

**Salary range:** ₹12–25 lakh per annum at Indian operations level. Senior surveyors with IACS experience earn significantly more.

**Travel:** Extensive — you follow the fleet, not a fixed location.

## Independent Surveyor — Freelance Path

Experienced surveyors often set up independent practices or join small surveying firms.

Requirements:
- Recognised qualifications (IIMS membership recommended)
- Professional indemnity insurance
- Network of clients (P&I clubs, cargo interests, port agents)
- Minimum 10 years relevant sea and/or survey experience

Income: Variable — ₹50,000–₹2 lakh per month for established independents.

## IIMS — The Professional Body

The International Institute of Marine Surveying (IIMS) is the globally recognised professional body. Membership demonstrates credibility.

Grades: Student → Associate → Member (MIIMS) → Fellow (FIIMS)

Apply via iims.org.uk. Indian chapter is active.
