# Superyacht Jobs for Indian Seafarers 2026

Superyachts are the glamorous end of maritime — Mediterranean summers, Caribbean winters, multi-million dollar vessels, and wealthy owners. But it's a different industry from merchant shipping, and the path in requires a different strategy. Here's the honest picture.

## What Is the Superyacht Industry?

Private superyachts are vessels typically over 24 meters owned by ultra-high-net-worth individuals. The fleet ranges from 30-meter sailing yachts to 100+ meter motor yachts crewed by 20–50 people.

The superyacht industry operates under a different regulatory framework from commercial shipping. Most are registered under small ship regulations (MCA LY3 Code in UK, or flag state equivalents) rather than full SOLAS.

## Roles on Superyachts

**Deck Department:**
- Captain (Master) — ultimately responsible for vessel and crew
- First Officer/Mate — watchkeeping, deck operations
- Bosun — deck maintenance, tenders, water sports equipment

**Engineering:**
- Chief Engineer — all machinery, generators, AC systems, toys
- Engineer — assistant to Chief

**Interior (not maritime roles, but important):**
- Chief Steward/Stewardess — hospitality management
- Stewards — service, cleaning, provisioning

**Deck/Interior crossover roles exist on smaller yachts (under 50 meters).**

## Qualifications Required

**For Officer roles:** Your STCW COC is a foundation, but the superyacht industry values additional qualifications:

- **STCW certificates** — STCW Basic Safety, PSSR, EFA, AFF, FPFF
- **MCA Yachtmaster Ocean** or OOW 500GT/3000GT — depends on yacht size
- **MCA/Flag state endorsement** for the specific yacht's flag
- **RYA/ASA powerboat/sailing qualifications** for smaller yachts

**Training centres:** There are no superyacht training centres in India. Training is done in UK (Southampton, Hamble), Fort Lauderdale (USA), or the French Riviera.

## Salary: What to Expect

| Role | Monthly Salary (EUR/USD) |
|---|---|
| Captain (50m yacht) | $8,000–$15,000 |
| Chief Officer (50m) | $5,000–$8,000 |
| Chief Engineer (50m) | $6,000–$10,000 |
| Second Officer | $3,500–$5,500 |
| Junior Engineer | $3,000–$4,500 |

Accommodation, food, and uniforms provided. Tips from owners can add 10–30% on charter yachts.

## The Reality for Indian Seafarers

**The honest answer:** Indian merchant navy officers face significant barriers in the superyacht industry.

**Why it's difficult:**
1. No superyacht training schools in India
2. The industry strongly prefers candidates who can travel to Antibes, Fort Lauderdale, or Palma de Mallorca for in-person registration at crew agencies
3. Superyacht crew agencies (YachtRecruit, Bluewater, Viking, Fraser) are Europe/USA based
4. Owners and captains are predominantly Western European — cultural bias exists

**What does work:**
- Engineer officers get better traction than deck (less culture-dependent)
- Sailing yacht engineers with electrical skills are in demand
- AV/tech systems engineers are increasingly sought (modern yachts have complex systems)

## How to Break In

1. Get STCW certificates updated — Basic Safety, PSSR, EFA
2. Get MCA/RYA Yachtmaster qualifications (requires travel to UK or Europe)
3. Register with crew agencies in person — visit Antibes or Palma during boat show season
4. LinkedIn networking with captains and owners
5. Consider a positioning trip on a delivery crew — get references

## Is It Worth It for Indian Officers?

**If you're mid-career and can afford the training and travel:** Potentially yes — quality of life is high, exotic locations, and salaries are comparable to senior merchant navy roles.

**If you're a junior officer:** Better to build COC credentials in conventional shipping first, then transition.

**If you're an engineer:** Best opportunity — the engineering skills gap in superyachts is real.
