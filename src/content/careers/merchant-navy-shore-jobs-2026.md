## Success Stories

**Capt. Rajesh (Master → Port Captain):**
"I planned my transition 2 years in advance. Got DPA certificate while sailing, networked with port officials. Now earning ₹45 LPA with regular family time."

**C/E Suresh (Chief Engineer → Technical Superintendent):**
"Started as Assistant Superintendent at ₹18 LPA. Within 3 years, heading technical department at ₹35 LPA. Work-life balance is much better."

**2/O Priya (Second Officer → Marine Surveyor):**

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Coming ashore without savings** - Have 12+ months expenses
2. **No planning** - Rushed decisions lead to bad jobs

6. **Burning bridges at sea** - You may need references

## Is Shore Life Right for You?
