# Tanker Ship Jobs 2026: The Highest-Paying Vessel Type

Tankers pay the most. That's the open secret of merchant navy careers. A Chief Officer on a chemical tanker earns 40–60% more than the same rank on a bulk carrier. But getting there requires specific endorsements and a deliberate career strategy.

## Types of Tankers and Earning Potential

### Oil Tankers (Crude and Product)
- VLCCs (Very Large Crude Carriers): 250,000–320,000 DWT — trade crude oil from Gulf to refineries
- Suezmax: 120,000–200,000 DWT
- Aframax: 80,000–120,000 DWT
- Product Tankers (MR, LR1, LR2): refined petroleum products

**Master salary on VLCC:** $12,000–$16,000/month

### Chemical Tankers
- Carry a wide range of chemicals — methanol, caustic soda, edible oils, acids
- More complex operations than oil tankers (cargo segregation, tank cleaning, inhibitors)
- Higher pay premium for complexity
- IMO 1, 2, 3 type vessels with different capability levels

**Chief Officer salary on Chemical Tanker:** $7,000–$10,000/month

### LNG/LPG Carriers
- Liquid Natural Gas and Liquefied Petroleum Gas
- Cryogenic cargo — complex and highly specialised
- Most difficult tanker segment to enter
- Exceptional pay — Master on LNG: $15,000–$22,000/month

## Mandatory Endorsements

You cannot work on a tanker without the relevant STCW tanker endorsements. These are separate from your COC.

### For Oil Tankers:
1. **Basic Training for Oil and Chemical Tanker Cargo Operations** (STCW Reg. V/1-1, para 1)
2. **Advanced Training for Oil Tanker Cargo Operations** (for officer in charge of cargo operations)

### For Chemical Tankers:
1. **Basic Training for Oil and Chemical Tanker Cargo Operations**
2. **Advanced Training for Chemical Tanker Cargo Operations**

### For LPG Tankers:
1. **Basic Training for Liquefied Gas Tanker Cargo Operations**
2. **Advanced Training for Liquefied Gas Tanker Cargo Operations**

### For LNG Tankers:
LNG requires all of the above plus company-specific training and simulator assessments.

## How to Get Tanker Endorsements in India

Approved training institutions (DG Shipping certified):
- HIMT (Hindustan Institute of Maritime Training), Chennai
- AMET, Chennai
- MERI, Kolkata
- Anglo-Eastern Maritime Training Centre, Mumbai
- National Maritime Academy, Chennai

**Duration:** Basic tanker course: 3–5 days. Advanced tanker course: 5–7 days.
**Cost:** ₹15,000–₹40,000 per course depending on institution and type.

## Career Strategy: How to Break Into Tankers

**Starting point (Junior Officer):**
- Get basic tanker endorsement BEFORE applying — it shows initiative
- Apply to tanker management companies with a targeted cover letter
- Start on product tankers (lower barrier to entry than VLCCs or chemical)
- Some officers start as a rank below their COC level to get the first tanker job — worth considering

**Building tanker experience:**
- First tanker contract: Focus on learning cargo operations, SIRE inspection preparation
- Get advanced endorsement at first opportunity
- Maintain meticulous cargo records — these matter for promotions

**Moving to chemical/LNG:**
- Get advanced chemical endorsement
- Chemical tanker operators (Odfjell, Stolt-Nielsen, MOL Chemical Tankers) recruit experienced product tanker officers
- LNG: Join companies that have LNG training programs (NYK, MOL, Pacific Gas)

## SIRE Inspections — The Tanker Reality

Tankers undergo frequent SIRE (Ship Inspection Report Program) inspections by oil majors (Shell, BP, Chevron). These are rigorous — hundreds of questions on cargo operations, safety systems, documentation. If your vessel fails a SIRE, the charterer can refuse to use you.

Tanker officers must know their SMS, cargo systems, and emergency procedures cold. There's no room for "I'll check the manual."

## Top Tanker Companies for Indian Officers

- Scorpio Tankers
- Stolt-Nielsen (chemical specialists)
- Odfjell (chemical specialists)
- Hafnia
