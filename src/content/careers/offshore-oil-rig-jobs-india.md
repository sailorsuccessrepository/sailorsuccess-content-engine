# Offshore Oil Rig Jobs for Indian Seafarers 2026

Offshore is a different world from conventional shipping. The rotations are better, the pay is competitive, and the work is genuinely interesting. But getting in requires specific moves. Here's the complete picture.

## Types of Offshore Vessels

**PSV — Platform Supply Vessel**
- Supplies offshore platforms (food, equipment, drilling fluids, fuel)
- Typically 60–100 meters
- Deck operations intensive — crane handling, cargo management
- DP (Dynamic Positioning) equipped

**AHTS — Anchor Handling Tug Supply**
- Moves semi-submersible rigs, lays/retrieves anchors
- Highly skilled deck work — dangerous when done wrong
- Strong demand near drilling campaigns

**OSV — Offshore Support Vessel** (general term for PSV + AHTS)

**MPSV/DSV — Multi-Purpose/Dive Support Vessel**
- Supports saturation and air diving operations
- Carries ROVs (Remotely Operated Vehicles)
- Highly specialised, excellent pay

**FPSO — Floating Production Storage Offloading**
- Not a support vessel — it IS the production facility
- Essentially a floating oil refinery and storage unit
- Terminal operators, not conventional ship officers

## How Offshore Differs from Conventional Shipping

| Factor | Conventional | Offshore |
|---|---|---|
| Rotation | 3–6 months on, 2–3 months off | 28/28, 21/21, or 14/14 |
| Ports | Worldwide | Fixed region (near oil fields) |
| COC | STCW COC required | STCW COC + DP certificate |
| Salary | Medium-high | High for DP-equipped vessels |

## The Critical Difference: Dynamic Positioning (DP)

Most offshore vessels use DP to maintain position without anchoring — near platforms, in rough sea states. **DP certificate is essential** for most offshore officer jobs.

### How to Get DP Certificate
1. **DPST (Dynamic Positioning Simulator Training)** — 5-day course at recognised DP training centre (Kongsberg, Nautical Institute approved schools)
2. **DP sea time** — minimum 30 days on a DP vessel under watchkeeping conditions
3. **Log book** — Nautical Institute DP log book completion
4. **DPO (Dynamic Positioning Operator)** certificate issued

**Where to do DP training in India:** Cochin, Mumbai, Chennai have Nautical Institute approved centres. Cost: ₹60,000–₹1,20,000 for DPST.

## Salary: What to Expect

- Junior DP Officer (Deck): ₹2.5–4 lakh/month
- Senior DP Officer: ₹4–7 lakh/month
- Master on AHTS: ₹6–10 lakh/month

Offshore salaries have recovered strongly post-2020 downturn with oil price recovery.

## Indian Offshore Companies

- Mercator Marine (ONGC contracts)
- Offshore Infrastructure Limited (OIL/ONGC)
- Deep Industries
- SeaTeam Management
- ENSCO/Valaris (international operators working in Indian waters)

International operators in Middle East (Bourbon, Tidewater, SWIRE) also hire Indian officers heavily.

## How to Make the Switch

1. Get your current COC upgraded to the rank you want to enter at
2. Complete DPST and start accumulating DP sea time
3. Apply to offshore crewing agencies — not standard shipping manning agents
4. Target vessels working in Indian waters first (easier to get the first job)
5. Build DP sea time, complete log book, get DPO certificate

**Timeline:** From decision to first offshore job — typically 6–12 months.
