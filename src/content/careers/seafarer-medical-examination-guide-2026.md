# Seafarer Medical Examination 2026: ENG-1 Complete Guide

The ENG-1 medical certificate is non-negotiable. No ENG-1, no sea service. Period.

## What Is ENG-1?

ENG-1 is the seafarer's medical fitness certificate issued by a DG Shipping approved doctor. It certifies you are physically and mentally fit for sea service. Valid for **2 years** (1 year for seafarers over 55).

## What the Medical Covers

### Vision — #1 Rejection Cause
**Deck Officers:**
- Distant vision: 6/6 in one eye, 6/9 in the other (with or without correction)
- **Colour perception: Must pass Ishihara test** — check this BEFORE choosing maritime career

**Engine Officers:**
- Distant vision: 6/12 in each eye acceptable
- Colour perception required but less strict than deck

### Hearing
Must hear forced whispered voice at 3 meters in each ear. Hearing aids generally not accepted.

### Cardiovascular
- Blood pressure within limits (systolic <160, diastolic <100 typically)
- ECG for candidates over 40

### Blood Tests
- CBC, fasting glucose, HIV, Hepatitis B&C (company dependent)
- **Drug screening — zero tolerance** (cannabis, opioids, amphetamines, cocaine)

### Psychological
History of epilepsy or serious psychiatric disorders assessed.

## How to Prepare

**3 months before:**
- Get colour vision test at any optometrist — don't discover a problem at the exam
- Start cardio exercise
- Stop smoking (lung function test)
- Stop recreational drugs entirely — traces remain for months

**1 month before:**
- Get glasses/contacts sorted if you need vision correction
- Control blood pressure if it's been high
- Avoid heavy alcohol 48 hours before
- Fast 8 hours before if blood glucose test included

## DG Shipping Approved Doctors

Only doctors on the **DG Shipping approved panel** can issue ENG-1. Find the list at dgshipping.gov.in → Seafarers → Medical Examination. Cost: ₹2,000–₹5,000 depending on city.

## Failing ENG-1

**Temporary unfit:** Minor issues (high BP, healing injury) — re-apply after treatment.

**Permanent unfit:** Colour blindness (deck), uncontrolled epilepsy, severe heart disease. Engine/ratings roles may still be possible.

**Restricted fitness:** "Fit for engine room only" or "not for watchkeeping" — limited career scope.

## Renewal

Set a reminder **3 months before expiry**. A lapsed ENG-1 = no sailing. Companies repatriate you immediately. Renewal requires the full examination again.

## Need Guidance on Your Specific Situation?

Borderline colour vision, old injuries, controlled conditions — all have nuances. **Ask SailorGPT** for personalised guidance at sailorsuccess.online.

## Fitness Training for ENG-1

Beyond the clinical tests, being physically fit helps with recovery from borderline results. Specific exercises:

**Cardiovascular health:**
- 30 minutes brisk walking or jogging daily reduces resting blood pressure by 5–8 mmHg over 8 weeks
- Helps with treadmill/exercise ECG if required

**Vision maintenance:**
- Screen time reduction before the test (less strain = better acuity)
- Ensure spectacles/contact lens prescription is current

**Hearing protection:**
- Use ear protection in engine rooms — long-term noise exposure causes progressive hearing loss
- Avoid loud music exposure in the month before the exam

A physically fit seafarer rarely fails ENG-1 on clinical grounds. The most common failures are preventable: colour blindness (discovered too late), substance use, or unmanaged blood pressure.
