# Shipping Company Interview Preparation 2026

A shipping company interview is different from any other job interview. They're not just testing your knowledge — they're testing whether they'd trust you with a $50 million vessel and a 25-person crew. Here's how to prepare properly.

## Types of Interviews You'll Face

**Cadet Sponsorship Interview**
Focus: Motivation, basic PCM knowledge, communication, discipline
Format: HR + basic technical, sometimes group discussion

**Officer of the Watch / Junior Officer**
Focus: Navigation or engineering fundamentals, emergency procedures, COC knowledge
Format: Technical + HR, sometimes written test first

**Senior Officer (Chief Officer, Chief Engineer)**
Focus: Management experience, ISM/SMS knowledge, cargo/machinery systems
Format: Senior manager panel, detailed technical grilling

## HR Round — What They're Really Asking

**"Why merchant navy?"**
Don't say "good salary." Say: "I've been drawn to the sea since childhood. The combination of technical challenge, international exposure, and the responsibility of keeping a vessel and crew safe — nothing else comes close."

**"Why our company?"**
Research them BEFORE the interview. Fleet type, company values, fleet size. Say: "Your fleet specialises in chemical tankers — a technically demanding segment where I want to develop my expertise."

**"Where do you see yourself in 5 years?"**
"Chief Officer / Second Engineer on your vessels, having completed my COC upgrade, and contributing to the safety culture of the fleet."

**"Tell me about a challenge you've overcome."**
Prepare a real story. Structure it: situation → action → result. Interviewers can spot manufactured answers.

## Technical Round — Deck

**Navigation and watchkeeping:**
- COLREGS — Rules 5, 8, 16, 17, 18, 19 (restricted visibility)
- GMDSS — distress frequencies, EPIRB, SART
- Chart correction procedures
- BRM (Bridge Resource Management) principles

**Safety:**
- Fire triangle and types of fire (A, B, C, D, K)
- SOLAS requirements — lifeboat, fire detection
- ISM Code — SMS, non-conformity reporting
- MARPOL — Annex I (oil), Annex V (garbage) requirements

**Cargo operations (varies by vessel type):**
- Container: stowage, lashing, dangerous goods
- Bulk: stability concerns, cargo holds ventilation
- Tanker: inert gas systems, ISGOTT, vetting

## Technical Round — Engine

**Main engine:**
- 2-stroke vs 4-stroke operation
- Fuel oil system, purification, viscosity control
- Scavenge fire causes and prevention
- Crankcase explosion prevention (crankcase relief valves)

**Auxiliary machinery:**
- Purifiers — operating principle, gravity disc selection
- Compressors — types, unloading sequence
- Refrigeration — R-404A, R-134a (alternatives to R-22)

**Safety systems:**
- SOLAS fire detection types
- Fixed CO2 system — precautions before release
- Emergency procedures — blackout recovery

## Practical Tips

**Dress code:** Formal. No exceptions. First impression lasts.

**Punctuality:** Arrive 15 minutes early. Shipping is about reliability.

**Body language:** Firm handshake, maintain eye contact, don't fidget.

**Documents:** Carry all originals + photocopies in a folder: COC, STCW certificates, CDC, passport, ENG-1, service record.

**Questions to ask them:** "What is the typical fleet rotation for this rank?" "How does the company support rank upgrades?" These show you're thinking long term.

## After the Interview

Send a brief thank you email within 24 hours. It's rare in India and immediately sets you apart.

## Mock Interview Practice

Practice out loud — not in your head. Record yourself. Watch the playback. You'll be surprised what you notice.
