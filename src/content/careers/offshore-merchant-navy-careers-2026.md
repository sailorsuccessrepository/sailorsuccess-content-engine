# Offshore Merchant Navy Careers 2026: Complete Guide to Oil Rig, FPSO & OSV Jobs

Offshore maritime careers offer some of the highest salaries in the shipping industry. Working on oil rigs, FPSOs, and offshore supply vessels combines technical maritime skills with the energy sector's premium compensation.

This guide covers everything Indian seafarers need to know about offshore careers - vessel types, job roles, eligibility, salaries, and how to break into this lucrative sector.

## Understanding Offshore Maritime Careers

Offshore maritime work differs significantly from traditional merchant shipping. Instead of cargo transport, offshore vessels support oil and gas exploration and production operations.

**Types of Offshore Operations:**

| Vessel Type | Function | Typical Duration |
|-------------|----------|------------------|
| FPSO (Floating Production Storage Offloading) | Oil/gas production and storage | 4-6 weeks on/off |
| Jack-up Rigs | Drilling in shallow waters | 4-6 weeks on/off |
| Semi-submersible Rigs | Deepwater drilling | 4-6 weeks rotation |
| OSV (Offshore Supply Vessels) | Platform supply and support | 4-6 weeks on/off |
| AHTS (Anchor Handling Tug Supply) | Anchor handling, towing | 4-6 weeks rotation |
| DSV (Diving Support Vessels) | Subsea construction, diving ops | 4-6 weeks on/off |
| PSV (Platform Supply Vessels) | Cargo supply to platforms | 4-6 weeks on/off |

## Offshore Job Roles for Indian Seafarers

**Deck Department:**

| Position | Requirements | Monthly Salary (USD) |
|----------|--------------|---------------------|
| Master (DPO) | Master COC + DP Certificate | $15,000-25,000 |

| Radio Operator | Communications | $3,500-5,000 |

## Why Offshore Pays More

Offshore salaries are 30-50% higher than conventional shipping because of:

**Working Conditions:**
- Hazardous environment (oil/gas operations)
- Remote locations far from shore
- Strict safety protocols
- Limited shore leave during rotation

**Skill Premium:**
- Specialized certifications required
- DP (Dynamic Positioning) skills valuable
- Technical expertise for complex operations
- High-risk operational environment

**Industry Economics:**
- Oil and gas companies have higher profit margins
- Critical operations require best talent
- Downtime costs millions, so quality crew essential

## Dynamic Positioning (DP) Certification

DP certification is the gateway to premium offshore positions. Vessels maintaining position using computerized systems (not anchors) require DP-qualified officers.

**DP Certificate Types:**

| Certificate | Requirements | Enables |
|-------------|--------------|---------|
| DP Basic/Induction | 5-day course | Entry to DP training |
| DP Advanced | DP Basic + sea time | DP operations |
| DP Unlimited | 180+ DP sea days | All DP vessel types |

**DP Training in India:**

- Maersk Training Centre, Mumbai
- Ocean Technologies Group
- Kongsberg Maritime Training
- Seagull Maritime Training

**DP Course Fee:** ₹80,000-1,50,000 for basic to advanced

## FPSO Careers: The Premium Segment

FPSOs (Floating Production Storage and Offloading) are the crown jewels of offshore careers. These massive vessels process crude oil at offshore fields and transfer to shuttle tankers.

**FPSO Characteristics:**
- Ship-shaped floating production facilities
- Stationed at single location for years
- Process millions of barrels of oil
- Crew rotations of 28/28 or 35/35 days
- Highest offshore salaries

**FPSO Operators Hiring Indians:**

| Company | Regions | Salary Level |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| SBM Offshore | Global | Premium |
| MODEC | Brazil, Africa | Premium |
| BW Offshore | Global | Premium |
| Yinson | Africa, ASEAN | Good |
| Bumi Armada | Malaysia, Africa | Good |
| ONGC (Indian) | India | Moderate |

**FPSO Salary Ranges:**

| Rank | Monthly (USD) |
|------|---------------|
| Master | $18,000-28,000 |
| Chief Engineer | $16,000-25,000 |
| Chief Officer | $12,000-18,000 |
| 2nd Engineer | $10,000-15,000 |
| ETO | $7,000-11,000 |

## OSV/AHTS Careers: Entry to Offshore

Offshore Supply Vessels (OSV) and Anchor Handling Tug Supply (AHTS) vessels are the workhorses of offshore operations. These are often the entry point for seafarers transitioning to offshore.

**OSV/AHTS Work Includes:**
- Supplying materials to platforms
- Anchor handling for rigs
- Towing offshore structures
- Emergency response standby
- Personnel transfer

**Major OSV/AHTS Companies:**

| Company | Fleet Size | Regions |

| Tidewater | 200+ vessels | Global |
| DOF Subsea | 80+ vessels | Norway, Global |
| Bourbon Offshore | 400+ vessels | Global |
