## Technical Questions for Engine Cadets

### Question 11: What is a 2-stroke vs 4-stroke engine?

**Answer:**
**2-Stroke Engine:**
- Power stroke every revolution
- Ports for air intake/exhaust
- Higher power-to-weight ratio
- Used for main propulsion

**4-Stroke Engine:**
- Power stroke every two revolutions
- Valves for inlet/exhaust
- More efficient at smaller sizes
- Used for auxiliary engines

### Question 12: What is scavenging?

**Answer:**
Scavenging is the process of removing exhaust gases and introducing fresh air into the engine cylinder. Types:
- Cross flow scavenging
- Loop scavenging
- Uniflow scavenging (most efficient, used in modern 2-stroke)

Purpose: Ensure complete combustion, cool cylinder, remove exhaust.

### Question 13: What is turbocharging?

**Answer:**
Turbocharging uses exhaust gas energy to compress intake air, allowing more fuel to be burned and increasing engine power. Components:
- Turbine side (driven by exhaust)
- Compressor side (compresses air)
- Bearing system

Benefits: Higher power output, better efficiency, reduced emissions.

### Question 14: Explain the starting air system

**Answer:**
Starting air system provides compressed air (25-30 bar) to start the main engine:
- Air compressors (2-3 units)

- Starting air valve on cylinders
- Distributor

Sequence: Bridge command → Control system → Distributor opens valves → Air pushes pistons → Engine starts → Fuel injection begins

**Answer:**
Governor controls engine speed by regulating fuel supply:
- Maintains set RPM regardless of load changes
- Prevents overspeed
- Enables speed changes as required

Types:

"Yes, I understand and accept this. It's part of the career I've chosen. I'll stay connected through calls and video chats. I believe the benefits - world travel, financial stability, career growth - make this worthwhile. I've mentally prepared myself for this aspect of sea life."

## Questions You Should Ask

### Good Questions to Ask

1. "What is the typical career progression timeline in your company?"
2. "What training opportunities do you provide for officers?"
3. "How does your mentorship program work onboard?"
4. "What types of vessels might I be assigned to?"
