### Behavioral Questions

Expect questions about handling pressure situations, team coordination during port operations, conflict resolution onboard, and adaptation to scheduled service demands.

## Tips for Success

If new to containers, consider starting with smaller companies to gain experience before applying to MSC. Container operations familiarity significantly improves selection chances.

### Document Readiness

Maintain updated documents with adequate validity remaining. MSC recruitment moves quickly, and document delays can cost opportunities.
