# Cadet Sponsorship Companies in India 2026

**Company sponsorship is the golden ticket to a merchant navy career.** Instead of paying ₹15-20 lakhs for pre-sea training, companies pay for you and guarantee sea time. This guide covers the best sponsorship opportunities and how to get them.

## What is Cadet Sponsorship?

### Benefits of Sponsorship

| Benefit | Details |
|---------|---------|
| Training fees | Fully paid by company |
| Guaranteed sea time | 12-18 months onboard |
| Stipend during training | ₹5,000-15,000/month |
| Placement assured | Job on completion |
| Career path | Clear progression |

### The Catch: Bond Period

**Bond requirements:**
- Serve with company for 2-5 years after COC
- If you leave early, repay training costs
- Some bonds are strict, others flexible

**Worth it?** Usually YES - the training quality and guaranteed sea time outweigh the bond.
