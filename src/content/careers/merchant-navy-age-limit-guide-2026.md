## FAQs

### I'm 26. Can I still join merchant navy?

For deck: No standard options. For engine: GME possible until 28 (with engineering degree). Consider ETO if electrical engineer.

### Do all institutes have the same age limit?

No, limits can vary by 1-2 years between institutes. Check specific institute requirements.

### Is there any merchant navy option after 30?

Sea-going positions: Very limited. Consider shore-based maritime careers like shipping company jobs, port operations, or maritime training.

### Why is deck officer age limit lower than GME?

GME candidates have already spent 4 years on engineering degree. Time is accounted for in the age limit.

### Can I join as Master directly if I'm older?

No, everyone must start from cadet/junior positions. Experience and COC exams are required for promotion.
