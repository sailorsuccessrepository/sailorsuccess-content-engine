# CDC Application Process Complete Guide 2026

The Continuous Discharge Certificate (CDC) is your passport to a merchant navy career. This mandatory document, issued by the Directorate General of Shipping (DG Shipping), is required for every Indian seafarer before joining their first ship. Understanding the CDC application process thoroughly can save you time, money, and unnecessary stress.

## What is CDC and Why Do You Need It?

The Continuous Discharge Certificate serves as an internationally recognized identity document for seafarers. Under the Merchant Shipping Act 1958 and STCW Convention requirements, no Indian seafarer can work on merchant vessels without a valid CDC. This document contains your complete sea service record, personal details, and biometric information.

The CDC is valid for 10 years from the date of issue and must be renewed before expiration. It's often the first document shipping companies ask for during the recruitment process, making it essential for launching your maritime career.

## Eligibility Criteria for CDC Application

Before applying for CDC, ensure you meet these basic requirements:

**Educational Qualification**: Minimum 10th standard pass certificate from a recognized board. For certain courses like GME or DNS, higher qualifications may be required, but for CDC itself, 10th pass is sufficient.

**Age Requirements**: You must be at least 18 years old on the date of application. There's no upper age limit for applying for CDC, though shipping companies may have their own age restrictions for employment.

**Medical Fitness**: You must possess a valid Pre-Sea Medical Examination Certificate (PEME) issued by a DG Shipping approved doctor. This medical fitness certificate proves you're physically and mentally fit for sea service and is mandatory before CDC application.

**Training Requirements**: Completion of pre-sea training is not mandatory for CDC application, but you'll need it before joining a ship. However, having your training certificates ready speeds up the entire joining process.

## Documents Required for CDC Application

Gathering the correct documents is crucial for a smooth application process. Here's the comprehensive checklist:

**Identity Proof** (any one):
- Aadhaar Card (most preferred)
- Passport
- Voter ID Card
- PAN Card

**Address Proof** (any one):
- Aadhaar Card
- Passport
- Bank Statement (last 3 months)
- Utility Bill (electricity/water, not older than 3 months)

**Educational Certificates**:
- 10th Standard Mark Sheet and Certificate
- 12th Standard certificates (if applicable)
- Degree certificates (if applicable)

**Medical Fitness Certificate**:
- PEME Certificate from DG Shipping approved doctor
- Must be valid (less than 1 year old)
- Original certificate required for verification

**Photographs**:
- 6 recent passport size color photographs
- White background
- 80% face coverage
- Professional attire recommended

**Additional Documents**:
- INDoS Number (if already registered)
- Bank Account Details for refund processing
- Email ID and mobile number for communication

## Step-by-Step CDC Application Process

### Step 1: INDoS Registration

Before applying for CDC, you must register on the Indian National Database for Seafarers (INDoS) system. Visit the official DG Shipping website (www.dgshipping.gov.in) and navigate to the e-Governance section.

Create your INDoS account with your email ID and mobile number. You'll receive an INDoS number, which is your unique seafarer identification number valid throughout your maritime career. This number will be printed on your CDC and used for all future interactions with DG Shipping.

### Step 2: Complete Online Application

Log into the e-Governance portal using your INDoS credentials. Navigate to the "Apply for CDC" section and fill the online application form carefully:

**Personal Information**: Enter your name exactly as it appears on your 10th certificate. Any mismatch can cause delays or rejection. Fill in your father's name, mother's name, date of birth, place of birth, and nationality.

**Contact Details**: Provide current residential address, permanent address, email ID, and mobile number. These details will be used for all official communication and document delivery.

**Physical Attributes**: Enter your height, weight, eye color, hair color, and any identification marks. These details help in your identification during port state control inspections.

**Emergency Contact**: Provide details of next of kin including name, relationship, address, and contact number. This information is crucial for emergencies at sea.

### Step 3: Document Upload

Scan and upload all required documents in the specified format:

- File format: PDF or JPEG
- Maximum file size: 2MB per document
- Clear and readable scans
- Color scans for photographs

Double-check each uploaded document for clarity. Blurred or unclear scans are common reasons for application rejection.

### Step 4: Fee Payment

The CDC application fee is approximately ₹1,500 (subject to change, check official website for current fee). Payment can be made through:

- Net Banking
- Debit/Credit Card
- UPI Payment
- Demand Draft (at MMD offices)

After successful payment, download and save the payment receipt. This receipt is required for tracking your application and for any refund processes if needed.

### Step 5: Biometric Enrollment

After online application submission, you'll receive an appointment for biometric enrollment at your nearest Mercantile Marine Department (MMD) office. Major MMD offices are located in:

- Mumbai
- Kolkata
- Chennai
- Kochi
- New Delhi (for landlocked state candidates)
- Visakhapatnam
- Goa

Visit the MMD office on your scheduled date with:
- Appointment letter (printed)
- All original documents
- Photocopies of all documents
- Application fee receipt

At the MMD office, officials will verify your original documents and capture:
- Fingerprints (all 10 fingers)
- Digital photograph
- Signature
- Iris scan (in some offices)

The biometric process typically takes 30-45 minutes. Ensure you dress formally and maintain neat appearance as your photograph will be printed on the CDC.

### Step 6: Document Verification

MMD officials will verify your original documents against the uploaded copies. They'll check:

- Educational certificate authenticity
- Medical certificate validity
- Identity and address proof verification
- Photograph compliance with standards

If any discrepancy is found, you'll be asked to submit correct documents. In some cases, you may need to restart the application process.

### Step 7: CDC Issuance

After successful verification, your CDC application enters the processing stage. The processing time varies:

- Normal Processing: 15-20 working days
- Expedited Processing: 7-10 working days (additional charges apply)
- Walk-in Service: Same day (limited slots, higher charges)

You'll receive an SMS and email notification when your CDC is ready for collection. Visit the same MMD office with:
- Appointment letter for collection
- Identity proof
- Application receipt

Your CDC will be handed over after final verification. Check all details on the CDC immediately for any errors.

## CDC Application Fees Breakdown 2026

Understanding the complete fee structure helps in budget planning:

**Basic Application Fee**: ₹1,500
**Service Charges**: ₹100
**Biometric Charges**: Included in application fee
**Reprint Charges** (if required): ₹500
**Expedited Processing**: Additional ₹1,000-2,000

For renewal or duplicate CDC:
**Renewal Fee**: ₹1,500
**Duplicate CDC**: ₹2,000
**Endorsement Addition**: ₹500 per endorsement

All fees are subject to revision. Always check the official DG Shipping website for current fee structure before applying.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Name Mismatch**: The most common reason for CDC rejection is name variation across documents. Ensure your name is exactly the same on all documents including 10th certificate, Aadhaar, and passport.

**Expired Medical Certificate**: Many applicants don't realize their PEME has expired during the application process. Check the validity date and renew if needed before applying.

**Poor Quality Documents**: Blurred scans, unclear photographs, or damaged original documents lead to rejection. Use a good scanner and maintain your original documents properly.

**Incomplete Application**: Missing information in the online form causes delays. Fill every field carefully and double-check before submission.

**Wrong INDoS Number**: Using someone else's INDoS number or typing errors in INDoS number creates serious complications. Verify your INDoS number before starting the application.

## Timeline and Processing Duration

Understanding the realistic timeline helps in planning your career start:

**INDoS Registration**: 1-2 days
**Online Application**: 1-2 hours
**Appointment Scheduling**: 3-7 days
**Biometric Enrollment**: 1 day
**Processing at MMD**: 15-20 days
**Total Duration**: 20-30 days (approximately)

During peak seasons (March-May), processing times may extend by 5-10 days due to high volume of applications.

## CDC Renewal Process

Your CDC must be renewed before expiration (valid for 10 years). The renewal process is simpler than first-time application:

1. Apply online through e-Governance portal
2. Upload latest PEME certificate
3. Pay renewal fee
4. Visit MMD for biometric update (if required)
5. Collect renewed CDC

Start renewal process 2-3 months before expiration to avoid any gap in your employment.

## Duplicate CDC Procedure

If your CDC is lost, damaged, or stolen:

1. File FIR at local police station (for lost/stolen CDC)
2. Publish newspaper advertisement in two newspapers (one English, one local language)
3. Submit affidavit declaring loss
4. Apply for duplicate CDC online
5. Pay duplicate CDC fee
6. Submit all documents at MMD
7. Collect duplicate CDC

The duplicate CDC will have all your previous endorsements and service records.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

**Application Rejected**: Check the rejection reason in your email notification. Most rejections are due to document issues. Correct the problem and reapply.

**Delayed Processing**: Track your application status on the e-Governance portal. If processing exceeds normal duration, contact the MMD office through email or phone.

**Biometric Mismatch**: If biometric verification fails during renewal, visit the MMD office for fresh biometric enrollment with your old CDC.

**Name Correction**: If you've legally changed your name after CDC issuance, submit a name change affidavit, newspaper publication proof, and updated documents at MMD for CDC amendment.

## Digital CDC vs Physical CDC

As of 2026, DG Shipping is transitioning to digital CDC system. However, physical CDC remains mandatory for ship joining:

**Digital CDC Benefits**:
- Instant access through mobile app
- No risk of physical loss
- Quick verification by port state control
- Easy endorsement updates

**Physical CDC Requirement**:
- Mandatory for port state control inspections
- Required during immigration checks
- Needed for contract signing

Carry both digital and physical CDC when joining ships.

## Important Tips for First-Time Applicants

**Start Early**: Begin your CDC application process at least 2 months before planned ship joining date. Unexpected delays can occur.

**Keep Backup Documents**: Maintain scanned copies of all documents in cloud storage. This helps if originals are lost or during renewal.

**Update Contact Details**: Inform DG Shipping immediately if you change your mobile number or email ID. Missing important notifications causes problems.

**Maintain Original Documents**: Store your educational certificates, medical certificates, and identity proofs safely. You'll need them multiple times during your career.

**Track Application Status**: Regularly check your application status online. Respond promptly to any queries from MMD office.

## Frequently Asked Questions

Most delays and rejections happen due to incomplete documentation or errors in application forms. Take your time, verify all information, and maintain original documents properly.

Remember that CDC is the foundation document of your maritime career. Any mistakes in CDC details can create problems throughout your seafaring life. If you're unsure about any step, seek guidance from experienced seafarers or maritime institutes before proceeding.
