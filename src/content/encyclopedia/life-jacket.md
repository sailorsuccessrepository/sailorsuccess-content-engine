**Safety Awareness**: Recognizing hazards, reporting defects, following safety procedures, and using personal protective equipment properly.

## Regulatory Compliance

### SOLAS Convention

Safety of Life at Sea Convention establishes fundamental requirements for life jacket:

**Mandatory Carriage**: Requirements specifying which vessels must carry specific equipment or implement particular procedures.

**Performance Standards**: Minimum acceptable performance criteria ensuring reliable operation under various conditions.

**Testing and Certification**: Regular testing protocols and certification requirements demonstrating continued compliance.

**Survey Requirements**: Inspection intervals and survey types verifying equipment condition and operational readiness.

### DG Shipping Enforcement

For Indian-flagged vessels and Indian seafarers:

**Statutory Certification**: Required certificates issued following successful surveys demonstrating regulatory compliance.

**Survey Schedule**: Prescribed inspection intervals including initial, annual, intermediate, renewal, and additional surveys.

**Crew Competency**: Certificate of Competency examinations testing comprehensive knowledge of life jacket.

**Port State Control**: Inspection by foreign port authorities verifying SOLAS compliance for Indian vessels.

### STCW Requirements

Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping establish competency requirements:

**Knowledge Standards**: Specific knowledge areas seafarers must demonstrate for certification at various ranks.

**Practical Skills**: Hands-on competency requirements demonstrating ability to perform procedures correctly.

**Training Courses**: Mandatory training programs providing systematic instruction and assessment.

**Certification Documentation**: Proper certification demonstrating completion of required training and assessment.

## Examination Preparation

### IMU-CET Coverage

Indian Maritime University entrance examination includes life jacket content:

- "How would you respond to emergency involving life jacket?"
- "Explain procedures for life jacket in specific situations"

## Common Misconceptions

**Misconception 1**: Surface knowledge suffices for examinations.

**Reality**: Examiners expect comprehensive understanding including technical details, practical procedures, regulatory framework, and professional judgment based on experience. Shallow knowledge is inadequate for certification.

**Misconception 2**: Life Jacket procedures are identical across all ships.

**Reality**: Significant variations exist between vessel types, manufacturers, and operational contexts. Each vessel requires familiarization with specific equipment and procedures.

**Misconception 3**: Compliance is flexible or negotiable.

**Reality**: SOLAS requirements are mandatory international law. Non-compliance results in vessel detention, delayed certification, safety risks, and professional consequences.
