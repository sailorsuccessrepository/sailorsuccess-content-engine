- Nautical mile: 1,852 meters (based on Earth's circumference)
- Statute mile: 1,609 meters (arbitrary historical definition)
- Kilometer: 1,000 meters (metric system)

Using wrong units causes serious navigation errors. A 100-mile difference represents 15.1% error if confusing nautical and statute miles.

**Professional Requirement**: Navigation charts, pilot books, and regulations specify which measurement unit applies. Using correct units is mandatory for safety and regulatory compliance.

### Misconception 2: Electronic Systems Eliminate Calculation Need

**Incorrect Belief**: GPS and ECDIS make manual distance calculations unnecessary.

**Reality**: Professional mariners must verify electronic system outputs through manual calculations. Equipment failures, software errors, and incorrect settings occur regularly at sea.

**Examination Requirement**: DG Shipping oral examinations specifically test manual calculation ability. Examiners disable or ignore electronic equipment during assessments.

**Safety Requirement**: SOLAS requires manual calculation competence as backup when electronic systems fail. Safe navigation depends on seafarer skill, not just equipment.

### Misconception 3: Approximate Conversions Suffice

**Incorrect Belief**: Close approximations like "1 nautical mile ≈ 2 kilometers" are adequate for professional navigation.

**Reality**: Navigation safety requires precise conversions:
- Exact: 1 nautical mile = 1.852 kilometers
- Error from "approximately 2": 8% (unacceptable in navigation)
- Cumulative errors over voyage distances create significant position uncertainty

**Professional Standard**: Use exact conversion factors for all calculations. Approximations acceptable only for rough mental estimates, never for actual navigation.

### Misconception 4: Chart Scale Doesn't Affect Distance Measurement

**Incorrect Belief**: Distance measured on any chart gives accurate sea distance regardless of scale or projection.

**Reality**: Chart projection and scale significantly affect distance measurement accuracy:
- Mercator projection: Use latitude scale at measurement position
- Gnomonic projection: Measurement requires special techniques
- Small-scale charts: Less precise for short distance measurement
- Electronic charts: Zoom level affects measurement accuracy

**Proper Technique**: Always use appropriate chart scale for intended distance measurement. Verify electronic chart units and projection type.
