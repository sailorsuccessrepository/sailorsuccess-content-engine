# Tax Planning for Indian Seafarers 2026

As a seafarer, you can legally save ₹10-30 lakhs in taxes every year. But many officers don't know the rules and end up paying taxes they don't owe. This guide ensures you're not one of them.

## The 182-Day Rule

The single most important rule for seafarer taxation:

**If you stay outside India for 182 days or more in a financial year, your foreign income is NOT taxable in India.**

### How It Works

| Scenario | Tax Status | Foreign Income Tax |
|----------|-----------|-------------------|
| Outside India 182+ days | NRI | Not taxable |
| Outside India <182 days | Resident | Taxable |

### Counting Days

**Days OUTSIDE India count:**
- Days on ship (international waters)
- Days in foreign ports
- Transit days
- Shore leave abroad

**Days IN India count:**
- Leave at home
- Training in India
- Transit through India

## NRI Status for Seafarers

### Determining Your Status

For FY 2025-26 (April 2025 - March 2026):

| Days Outside India | Status | Foreign Income |
|-------------------|--------|----------------|
| 182+ days | NRI | Not taxable |
| 120-181 days | Resident* | May be taxable |
| <120 days | Resident | Taxable |

*Special rules apply - consult a CA

### Documents to Maintain

**Essential records:**
1. CDC with embarkation/disembarkation stamps
2. Sign-on/Sign-off letters
3. Passport with all stamps
4. Sea service certificates
5. Voyage records

## Income Types and Taxation

### Strategy 2: Structure Your Income

**For NRIs:**

## Filing Requirements

### For NRIs

**Must file return if:**
- Total income in India exceeds ₹2.5 lakhs

**Need NOT file if:**
- No Indian income above threshold
- No capital gains

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Wrong Day Counting
Counting only ship days, ignoring foreign port days.

**Solution**: Count all days outside India

### Mistake 2: Not Maintaining Records
No proof of days outside India.

**Solution**: Keep CDC updated, save all documents

### Mistake 3: Declaring NRI Without Qualifying
Assuming NRI status without 182+ days.

**Solution**: Calculate precisely before filing

### Mistake 4: Wrong Bank Accounts
Using regular savings accounts instead of NRO/NRE.

### Mistake 5: Missing Filing Deadlines
Assuming NRIs don't need to file.
