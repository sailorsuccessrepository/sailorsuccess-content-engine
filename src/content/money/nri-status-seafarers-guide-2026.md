# NRI Status for Seafarers: Complete Tax Guide

Seafarers can legally pay ZERO income tax in India by claiming NRI status. This guide explains exactly how to do it right and save lakhs every year.

## Why NRI Status Matters

### Tax Difference

| Status | Indian Income Tax | Foreign Income Tax |
|--------|------------------|-------------------|
| Resident | Taxable | Taxable |
| NRI | Taxable | Not taxable |

**For Seafarers:**
- Ship income is foreign income
- NRI status = Zero tax on ship salary
- Potential savings: ₹10-30+ lakhs per year

### Example Savings

| Annual Income | Resident Tax | NRI Tax | Savings |
|---------------|-------------|---------|---------|
| ₹20 lakhs | ~₹4.5 lakhs | ₹0 | ₹4.5 lakhs |
| ₹40 lakhs | ~₹11 lakhs | ₹0 | ₹11 lakhs |
| ₹80 lakhs | ~₹25 lakhs | ₹0 | ₹25 lakhs |

## The 182-Day Rule

### Basic Rule

To be NRI for a financial year (April 1 - March 31):
- Stay outside India for **182 days or more**

**That's it.** 182 days outside = NRI status.

### How to Count

**Outside India means:**
- On ship (international waters)
- In foreign ports
- In transit abroad
- On foreign leave

**Inside India means:**
- Home leave
- Training in India
- Signing on/off in Indian ports
- Any day you're physically in India

### Calculation Method

**Financial Year:** April 1, 2025 - March 31, 2026

**Days in year:** 365

**To be NRI:** Outside India ≥ 182 days

**Can stay in India:** Maximum 183 days

### Example Calculation

| Month | Days Outside | Days in India |
|-------|-------------|---------------|
| April | 30 | 0 |
| May | 31 | 0 |
| June | 30 | 0 |
| July | 31 | 0 |
| August | 25 | 6 |
| September | 0 | 30 |
| October | 15 | 16 |
| November | 30 | 0 |
| December | 31 | 0 |
| January | 31 | 0 |
| February | 28 | 0 |
| March | 0 | 31 |
| **Total** | **282** | **83** |

**Result:** 282 days outside > 182 days = NRI ✓

## Documentation Required
