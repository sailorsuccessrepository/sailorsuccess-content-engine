# Health Insurance for Seafarers 2026

**One medical emergency can wipe out years of savings.** Seafarers face unique health risks, and relying solely on company insurance is a mistake. This guide helps you choose the right health coverage for yourself and family.

## Why Seafarers Need Personal Health Insurance

### Company Insurance Limitations

| Factor | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| Coverage period | Only during contract |
| Gap between contracts | Often NO coverage |
| Family coverage | Usually excluded |
| Post-retirement | Nothing |
| Choice of hospital | Company decides |

**The gap problem:** If you're home for 3 months between contracts and have a health issue - you're on your own.

## Types of Health Insurance for Seafarers

### 1. P&I Club Insurance (Company Provided)

**What it covers:**
- Illness during contract
- Injury onboard
- Medical repatriation
- Death benefits

**Limitations:**
- Only while employed
- Company decides treatment
- No family coverage
- Ends with contract

### 2. Personal Health Insurance

**Benefits:**
- Continuous coverage
- Your choice of hospitals
- Family included
- Home between contracts
- Post-retirement coverage

### 3. Family Floater Plans

**Best for:**
- Self + spouse + children
- Single premium for all
- Sum insured shared
- Cost-effective

### 4. NRI-Specific Health Plans

**For NRI status seafarers:**
- Coverage in multiple countries
- Higher sum insured
- Dollar-denominated options
- Premium in INR or USD
