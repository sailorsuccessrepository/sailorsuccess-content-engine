# Maritime Law Basics for Indian Seafarers 2026

**Ignorance of law is no excuse - especially at sea.** As a seafarer, understanding basic maritime law protects you from exploitation, helps you claim your rights, and can even save your career. This guide covers the essential legal knowledge every Indian seafarer needs.

## Why Maritime Law Matters to You

Maritime law (also called admiralty law) governs everything that happens at sea:
- Your employment contract
- Your wages and benefits
- Your safety and health
- What happens if you're injured
- What happens if the ship is in trouble

**Not knowing your rights = Companies taking advantage of you.**

## Key Maritime Conventions Protecting Seafarers

### 1. Maritime Labour Convention (MLC) 2006

The "Seafarers' Bill of Rights" - ratified by India in 2015.

**What MLC Guarantees:**

| Written contract | Seafarer Employment Agreement (SEA) |
| Wages | Monthly payment, no unreasonable deductions |
| Working hours | Maximum 14 hours/day, 72 hours/week |
| Rest hours | Minimum 10 hours/day, 77 hours/week |
| Leave | Minimum 2.5 days per month of service |
| Repatriation | Company must return you home |
| Medical care | Free medical treatment onboard |
| Health & safety | Safe working environment |

### 2. STCW Convention
