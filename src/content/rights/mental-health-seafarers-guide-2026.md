## FAQs

### Will seeking mental health help affect my CDC or career?

Seeking help is confidential between you and medical professionals. Treatment records are protected. Untreated issues that affect performance are more likely to impact your career.

### Can I be repatriated for mental health reasons?

Yes, under MLC 2006, you have the right to medical repatriation if your condition requires treatment ashore. Mental health is recognized as a medical issue.

### What if my company doesn't support mental health?

Contact DPA, use external helplines, document any concerns. You can also report to flag state authorities or ITF if your legitimate health needs are being ignored.

### How do I help a colleague who refuses help?

Express concern without pressure, provide information about resources, maintain regular check-ins, involve Master if safety concerns arise. You cannot force someone to seek help, but you can be supportive.

### Is it normal to feel down after long contracts?

Adjustment challenges are common. If feelings persist beyond a few weeks or significantly affect functioning, seek professional support. Post-sea adjustment is a recognized challenge.
