## FAQs

### Can I terminate my contract early?

Yes, but check notice period requirements. Valid reasons include health issues, family emergency, or unsafe conditions. Unjustified early termination may affect future employment.

### What if company doesn't honor contract terms?

Document everything, complain to captain, then flag state. ITF can assist if company is non-compliant. MLC provides protection mechanisms.

### Is verbal agreement valid for maritime employment?

Written SEA is mandatory under MLC 2006. Verbal agreements are not legally binding. Always insist on written contract before joining.

### Can contract be in only English if I don't understand it?

You should understand your contract. Request translation or explanation. Don't sign what you don't understand. Company must provide comprehensible version.

### What happens if company goes bankrupt mid-contract?

Insurance should cover wages owed. Flag state may arrange repatriation. P&I club of the vessel is last resort for claims.
