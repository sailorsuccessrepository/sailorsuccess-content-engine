# Seafarer Wage Claims: How to Recover Unpaid Salaries in India 2026

Wage theft is one of the most common problems faced by seafarers worldwide. Companies may delay payments, refuse overtime compensation, or abandon crews without settling dues. Indian seafarers often don't know their rights or the procedures to recover unpaid wages.

This comprehensive guide explains how to recover unpaid salaries, understand your legal protections, and take effective action when companies fail to pay.

## Understanding Seafarer Wage Rights

### What Constitutes Wages?

Under MLC 2006 and Indian maritime law, wages include:

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Basic Salary | Fixed monthly compensation |
| Overtime | Work beyond 8 hours/day |
| Leave Pay | Accumulated leave wages |
| Bonus | Contractual bonuses |
| Allowances | Hardship, tanker, etc. |
| Gratuity | End-of-contract payment |
| Repatriation | Travel costs home |

### Legal Framework

**International:**
- Maritime Labour Convention 2006 (MLC)
- ILO Conventions on wages
- Flag state regulations

**Indian:**
- MS Act 1958
- Seafarers Wages Act
- Employment contracts

### Payment Frequency Requirements

Under MLC 2006:
| Aspect | Requirement |
|--------|-------------|
| Payment Interval | Monthly (maximum) |
| Currency | As agreed in contract |
| Payment Method | Bank transfer preferred |
| Pay Slip | Detailed breakdown required |
| Allotment | Family remittance facility |

## Common Wage Problems

### Types of Non-Payment Issues

1. **Complete Non-Payment**: No salary for months
2. **Partial Payment**: Reduced amounts without explanation
3. **Overtime Denial**: Work done but not compensated
4. **Leave Pay Withheld**: Accumulated leave not paid
5. **Delayed Payment**: Consistent late payments
6. **Abandonment**: Company disappears

### Warning Signs

| Warning Sign | Risk Level |
|--------------|------------|
| Frequent delays | Medium |
| Excuses about banking | High |
| Company communication stops | Critical |
| Vessel detained | High |
| No response from agent | Critical |
| Other crew reporting same | High |

### High-Risk Situations

Be cautious when:
- Working for unknown companies
- Through unlicensed agents
- Verbal agreements without contract
- Flags of convenience with poor records
- Old vessels with minimal activity

## Your Rights Under MLC 2006

### Standard A2.2: Wages

Key provisions:
1. Payment at least monthly
2. Full and final settlement at end of contract
3. No unauthorized deductions
4. Right to allot portion to family
5. Exchange rate protections

### Maritime Lien

**Powerful Protection:**
Seafarer wages are a maritime lien on the vessel, meaning:
- Your wage claim has priority over most other debts
- The ship can be arrested for unpaid wages
- Lien survives sale of vessel to new owner

**Priority Order of Claims:**
1. Seafarer wages
2. Salvage claims
3. Collision/damage claims
4. Mortgages
5. Other claims

### Repatriation Rights

If abandoned or contract terminated:
- Company must pay travel home
- Wages continue until repatriation
- Embassy support available
- MLC state responsibility kicks in

## Step-by-Step Wage Recovery Process

### Step 1: Document Everything

**Essential Records:**

### Step 2: Internal Resolution

**Direct Approach:**
1. Write formal letter to company
2. Send via email with read receipt

**Sample Wage Claim Letter:**
```
