## FAQs

### Can computer science or IT engineers do GME?

No, GME requires core engineering (mechanical, electrical, or related). Computer science and IT graduates should consider DNS (Deck) course if interested in maritime.

### Is GME from a private institute less valuable?

No, what matters is DG Shipping approval. Private and government institutes are equally recognized. Focus on placement record and training quality.

### What is the bond period for sponsored candidates?

Typically 2-5 years depending on the company. Bond includes service commitment, not necessarily specific salary. Read bond terms carefully before signing.

### Can I do GME after working in shore industry?

Yes, many GME candidates join after 1-3 years of shore experience. Maximum age is 28, so plan accordingly. Your industrial experience is an asset.

### What is the placement rate for good GME institutes?

Top institutes achieve 90-100% placement. Even mid-tier institutes have 70-80%+ placement. Your performance in course significantly affects opportunities.
