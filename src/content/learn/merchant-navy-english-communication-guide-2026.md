# English Communication for Merchant Navy 2026

**English is the universal language of the sea.** Regardless of your native language, effective English communication is non-negotiable for a maritime career. Poor communication causes accidents, delays careers, and costs jobs.

## Why English Matters at Sea

### IMO Mandate

International Maritime Organization requires:
- All ship communications in English
- Bridge team language: English
- Emergency communications: English
- Documentation: English

### Real Consequences of Poor English

| Situation | Impact of Poor English |
|-----------|----------------------|
| Bridge orders | Navigation errors, collisions |
| Emergency | Delayed response, casualties |
| Radio communication | Misunderstanding, accidents |
| Documentation | Legal problems, detentions |
| Interview | Job rejection |

## Maritime English: The Basics

### Standard Marine Communication Phrases (SMCP)

SMCP is the standardized set of phrases for maritime communication.

**Key categories:**
1. External communications (ship-to-shore, ship-to-ship)
2. Onboard communications (bridge-engine, safety)
3. Emergency communications

### Essential SMCP Examples

**Helm Orders:**
| Order | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| Midships | Rudder to zero |
| Port ten | Ten degrees to port |
| Starboard twenty | Twenty degrees to starboard |
| Hard to port | Maximum rudder to port |
| Steady | Maintain present heading |
| Ease to five | Reduce rudder to five degrees |

**Engine Orders:**
| Order | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Dead slow ahead | Minimum forward speed |
| Slow ahead | Slow forward |
| Half ahead | Half power forward |
| Full ahead | Full power forward |
| Stop engine | Cease propulsion |
| Full astern | Maximum reverse |

**VHF Radio Communication:**
- "This is [vessel name], [call sign]"
- "Over" - end of transmission, awaiting response
- "Out" - end of communication
- "Roger" - message received and understood
- "Say again" - repeat your message
- "Affirmative/Negative" - yes/no

### Communication Protocol

**Standard message format:**
1. Identity (who you are)
2. Position (where you are)
3. Intentions (what you're doing)
4. Request/Information
5. Closing

**Example:**
"Mumbai Port Control, this is MV Ocean Star, call sign ALFA BRAVO CHARLIE DELTA, position two miles south of pilot station, request pilot boarding time, over."
