# Sample Learn Content

This is a placeholder markdown file demonstrating the structure of content in the learn collection.

## Content Structure

Content collections in this repository follow a strict schema defined in `src/content/config.ts`.

## Purpose

This file exists to validate:
- Content collection schema
- Frontmatter parsing
- Dynamic routing functionality

**This is routing engine only. No UI implementation.**
