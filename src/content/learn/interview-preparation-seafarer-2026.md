## FAQs

### How do I answer if I don't know something technical?

Be honest: "I'm not fully certain about that, but based on my understanding..." Interviewers respect honesty over bluffing. Ask if you can explain a related topic you do know.

### Should I mention salary in the first interview?

Let the interviewer bring it up first. If asked, give a researched range. Focus first on fit and opportunity, salary discussion usually comes later.

### How long should my answers be?

Most answers should be 1-2 minutes. Use the "traffic light" rule: Green for first 30 seconds, yellow at 1 minute, red (stop) at 2 minutes unless specifically asked for detail.

### What if I don't have experience they're asking about?

Be honest but show willingness: "I haven't had that specific experience, but I've done [related task] and I'm eager to learn. Here's how I would approach it..."

### Can I take notes during the interview?

Yes, brief notes are professional. Ask permission first: "Do you mind if I take some notes?" This shows you're engaged and prepared.
