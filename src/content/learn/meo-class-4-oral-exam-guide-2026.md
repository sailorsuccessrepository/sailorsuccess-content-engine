### Sample Mock Session

**Examiner**: Good morning, please sit. Let's start with your last ship. What was the main engine type?

**Candidate**: Good morning, Sir. My last vessel was MV Ocean Pride, a container ship with MAN B&W 6S60ME-C main engine, rated at 15,000 kW at 100 RPM.

**Examiner**: Good. What would you do if the main engine exhaust temperature of unit 3 suddenly increased?

**Candidate**: Sir, I would first reduce RPM and inform the bridge. Then I would check the fuel injection timing, injector condition, and exhaust valve. I would also verify turbocharger performance and scavenge air pressure. If exhaust temperature remains high, we may need to investigate piston ring condition and liner wear.
