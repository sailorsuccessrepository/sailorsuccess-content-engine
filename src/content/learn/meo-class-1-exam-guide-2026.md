## MEO Class 1 Oral Examination Preparation

The oral examination is comprehensive and scenario-based. Examiners test your ability to handle real-world situations as Chief Engineer.

### Common Oral Questions

**Engine Room Emergency Scenarios:**

Q: Main engine fails to start when required for maneuvering. What actions do you take?
A: Inform bridge immediately, engage turning gear and try starting again, check starting air pressure, fuel supply, governor setting, interlocks (turning gear, slow turning), fresh water temperature, lube oil pressure. If unable to start, prepare for anchoring, investigate systematically.

Q: Crankcase explosion occurs. What immediate actions?
A: Stop engine if running, do not open crankcase for at least 20 minutes, activate fixed fire extinguishing if required, evacuate engine room if necessary, inform bridge, prepare emergency equipment. After cooling, investigate cause before restarting.

Q: Scavenge fire occurs. How do you handle?
A: Reduce speed to slow, shut off fuel to affected cylinder, increase cylinder oil, close scavenge drains, activate fire extinguishing if fitted, prepare external hoses. Do not stop engine unless absolutely necessary as this may worsen fire.

**Management Scenarios:**

Q: As Chief Engineer, how do you implement the ISM Code?
A: Ensure SMS manual is understood by all, conduct regular drills and training, maintain proper documentation, hold safety meetings, perform internal audits, manage non-conformities, maintain communication with DPA, ensure continuous improvement.

Q: How do you manage crew fatigue?
A: Ensure compliance with MLC work hour limits, plan maintenance to avoid excessive workload, schedule rest periods properly, monitor work/rest records, create supportive environment, recognize signs of fatigue, avoid safety-critical tasks when fatigued.

**Technical Problem-Solving:**

Q: Main engine power is reducing. How do you troubleshoot?
A: Check fuel quality and treatment, scavenge pressures and temperatures, exhaust temperatures, turbocharger performance, air cooler efficiency, injector condition, piston ring condition through scavenge port inspection, compression pressures.

Q: Generator trips on overload. What's your approach?
A: Check actual load vs generator capacity, verify power management system settings, check for faulty loads, ensure proper load sharing, check governor and AVR settings, inspect for short circuits, verify cable connections.
