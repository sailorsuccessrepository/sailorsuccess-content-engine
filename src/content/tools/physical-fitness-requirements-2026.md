# Merchant Navy Physical Fitness Requirements 2026: Complete Guide

Physical fitness is non-negotiable for merchant navy careers. Ships operate in demanding conditions where crew must handle emergencies, heavy equipment, and long working hours. This guide covers all physical requirements and how to prepare for them.

## Why Physical Fitness Matters

Seafarers face unique challenges:
- Emergency response requirements
- Heavy manual work
- Extreme weather conditions
- Limited medical facilities at sea
- Long contract periods (6-9 months)

## Basic Physical Requirements

### Height Requirements

| Female (Minimum) | 152 cm | 152 cm | 150 cm |
| Maximum | No limit | No limit | No limit |

**Note:** Some companies have higher requirements. Offshore and cruise lines may require 160+ cm for males.

### Body Mass Index (BMI) Calculation

BMI = Weight (kg) / Height (m)²
