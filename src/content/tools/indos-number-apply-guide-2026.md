# INDOS Number Online Application Guide 2026

**Your INDOS (Indian National Database of Seafarers) number is your permanent identity as an Indian seafarer.** Without it, you cannot apply for CDC, appear for DG Shipping exams, or join any vessel. This guide walks you through the complete online application process.

- Remains with you throughout your maritime career

- Is mandatory for joining any merchant vessel

**Important**: One person can have only ONE INDOS number. If you've already registered, do not create duplicate entries.

## How to Check INDOS Application Status

1. Login to DG Shipping portal
2. Go to "My Applications"
3. View status of your INDOS application

Status meanings:
- **Submitted**: Application received
- **Under Verification**: Documents being checked
- **Query Raised**: Additional information needed
- **Approved**: INDOS number allotted
- **Rejected**: Application denied (reasons provided)

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Name Mismatch
Your name must match EXACTLY across all documents. Even small variations like "KUMAR" vs "Kumar" can cause rejection.

**Solution**: Use passport name as standard for all entries.

### 2. Poor Quality Scans
Unclear or blurry document scans lead to rejection.

**Solution**: Use proper scanning apps, ensure good lighting, check readability before upload.

### 3. Wrong Document Format
Uploading documents in wrong format causes errors.

**Solution**: Convert all documents to PDF. Keep file size under 500 KB.

### 4. Incomplete Information
Leaving fields blank or entering "NA" incorrectly.

**Solution**: Fill all mandatory fields. If something doesn't apply, check if the field is actually mandatory.

### 5. Multiple Applications
Creating multiple applications for same person.

**Solution**: One person should have only ONE INDOS number. If previous application exists, track it instead of creating new.

## What to Do If INDOS Application is Rejected?

1. **Read rejection reason carefully** - DG Shipping provides specific reasons
2. **Correct the issues** - Usually document quality or information mismatch
3. **Reapply** - Submit fresh application with corrections
4. **Fee is non-refundable** - You'll need to pay again for reapplication

Common rejection reasons:
- Name mismatch between documents
- Unclear photographs
- Invalid/expired documents
- Incomplete information
- Duplicate application detected
